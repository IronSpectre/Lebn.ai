# Google Apps Script Deployment for Organization Account

Since you need to use your organization email (lebn.ai), here are the solutions:

## Option 1: Enable "Anyone" Access in Organization Settings (Recommended)

1. **Ask your Google Workspace Admin** to enable external access for Apps Script:
   - Go to admin.google.com
   - Apps > Google Workspace > Google Apps Script
   - Sharing settings > Allow users to share projects outside of [organization]
   - Web App Settings > Allow "Anyone" access option

2. **Then deploy normally:**
   - Use the code from `google-apps-script-org.js`
   - Deploy with "Execute as: Me" and "Who has access: Anyone"

## Option 2: Use a Proxy Service (Quick Solution)

Since you already have SheetDB set up, you could use that as your primary solution. But if you want to use Apps Script:

1. **Create a simple proxy using Vercel or Netlify:**
   ```javascript
   // Create a serverless function that forwards to your Apps Script
   export default async function handler(req, res) {
     const response = await fetch('YOUR_APPS_SCRIPT_URL', {
       method: 'POST',
       headers: {
         'Content-Type': 'text/plain',
       },
       body: JSON.stringify(req.body)
     });
     const data = await response.text();
     res.status(200).json(JSON.parse(data));
   }
   ```

## Option 3: Use API Key Authentication (Within Organization)

1. **Update your Apps Script** with the code from `google-apps-script-org.js`

2. **Deploy with these settings:**
   - Execute as: Me (your organization account)
   - Who has access: "Anyone within [lebn.ai]"

3. **Create a service account** in your organization:
   - Go to console.cloud.google.com
   - Create a new project or select existing
   - Enable Google Sheets API
   - Create service account credentials
   - Share your spreadsheet with the service account email

4. **Update your backend** to use the service account to call Apps Script

## Option 4: Use Google Cloud Functions (Best for Production)

1. **Create a Cloud Function** in your GCP project:
   ```javascript
   const {google} = require('googleapis');
   
   exports.saveToSheets = async (req, res) => {
     // Authenticate with service account
     const auth = new google.auth.GoogleAuth({
       scopes: ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets']
     });
     
     const sheets = google.sheets({version: 'v4', auth});
     
     // Save data to sheets
     await sheets.spreadsheets.values.append({
       spreadsheetId: '1RIcRHp4MdztQegVdPkIGA36iuO8LgOT0dD9UU1VzMdA',
       range: 'A:Z',
       valueInputOption: 'USER_ENTERED',
       requestBody: {
         values: [[/* your data */]]
       }
     });
     
     res.json({success: true});
   };
   ```

2. **Deploy with public access** (Cloud Functions can be public even in org accounts)

## Option 5: Hybrid Approach (Immediate Solution)

Since the Apps Script has authentication issues with your org account, use BOTH:

1. **Keep saving to your local database** (already working)
2. **Use SheetDB for Google Sheets** (you already set this up)
3. **Optional: Set up a daily sync** from database to sheets using Apps Script (can run within org)

## Current Working Solution

Since you mentioned you already set up SheetDB, that's actually the best immediate solution. The SheetDB integration I wrote earlier will work perfectly without any organization restrictions.

Would you like me to:
1. Complete the SheetDB integration (recommended - will work immediately)
2. Set up a Cloud Function for you
3. Create a proxy service configuration

Let me know which approach you prefer!
